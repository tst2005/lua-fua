DWAS philosophy
===============


What means DWAS ?
-----------------

It's my own acronym. `DWAS` stands for `Deals-with-all-shit`.


What is the DWAS philosophy ?
-----------------------------

 * forget to targeting perfection
 * stop to make from scratch, use already existing code base (good and bad things)
 * focused on bad things, to limit bad behavior as most as possible. 
 * make stuff to deal with shit
